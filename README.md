# Getting w/ GertBot
Local chat app that saves the data, prompt, and response in Markdown with keywords tagged for use in Obsidian
- Change env.example to .env
- enter your openai key and choose which local path you would like markdown files saved.  (I use a specific folder in Obsidian)
- run yarn install
- run yarn app

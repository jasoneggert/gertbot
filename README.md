# Getting w/ GertBot
Local chat app that saves the data, prompt, and response in Markdown with keywords tagged for use in Obsidian
- Change env.example to .env
- enter your openai key and choose which local path you would like markdown files saved.  (I use a specific folder in Obsidian)
- if you would like to automatically replace any specific words in the prompts (eg. for privacy or IP reasons) define them in the env following the naming convention present in the env.example
- run yarn install
- run yarn app
